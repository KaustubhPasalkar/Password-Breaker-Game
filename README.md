# Password-Breaker-Game
Developed a console-based Password Breaker Game where players guess a randomly chosen password from a list. The game has two modes: Easy (unlimited guesses, feedback on correct letters) and Hard (5 guesses, feedback on correct letters and remaining attempts). Players can quit anytime, revealing the correct password, and replay if desired.
